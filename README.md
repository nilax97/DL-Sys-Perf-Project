# BENCHMARKED INSIGHTS CALCULATOR FOR CNNs/DNNs

### By Nilaksh Agarwal (NA2886), Chandan Suri (CS4090)

#### Course project for COMSE6998_012_2021 - RACTICAL DEEP LEARNING SYSTEM PERFORMANCE under Prof. Parijat Due

## Motivation:

1. Very hard to gauge training time for a model based on the model parameters & GPU.

2. Cost & Availability of GPUs is a big concern which can be resolved using a benchmarking calculator!

3. Correlation between model parameters is mostly an unknown for different CNNs and FC networks.
